\description{
Visualizes the stoichiometry matrix using standard plot methods. The sign
of stoichiometric factors is displayed as upward and downward pointing
triangles. Also visualized are dependencies of process rates on variables.
}
\note{
The values of state variables and parameters must have been set using
  the \code{\link{setVars}} and \code{\link{setPars}} methods. If the
  stoichiometric factors are mathematical expressions involving
  function references, these functions must be defined in R (even if the
  numerical computations are based on generated Fortran code).
}
\examples{
data(vars, pars, funs, pros, stoi)
model <- rodeo$new(vars, pars, funs, pros, stoi, dim=c(1))
model$setVars(c(bac=0.1, sub=0.5))
model$setPars(c(mu=0.8, half=0.1, yield= 0.1, vol=1000, flow=50, sub_in=1))
monod <- function(c,h) {c/(c+h)}
model$plotStoichiometry(box=c(1))
}
\seealso{
See other methods of the \code{\link{rodeo-class}} or
  \code{\link{stoichiometry}} for computing the stoichiometric factors only.
  Alternative options for displaying stoichiometry information are described
  in the package vignette.
