Title: A Code Generator for ODE-Based Models

Description: Provides an R6 class and several utility methods to
    facilitate the implementation of models based on ordinary
    differential equations. The heart of the package is a code generator
    that creates compiled 'Fortran' (or 'R') code which can be passed to
    a numerical solver. There is direct support for solvers contained
    in packages 'deSolve' and 'rootSolve'.

Imports:
    R6,
    deSolve
VignetteBuilder: knitr
Suggests:
    knitr,
    rmarkdown,
    xtable,
    rootSolve
SystemRequirements: The tools to run 'R CMD SHLIB' on 'Fortran' code.
  The used 'Fortran' compiler must support pointer initialization which
  is a feature of the 2008 standard. The compiler from Oracle Developer
  Studio 12.6 on Solaris 10 currently does not meet this requirement.
